# PRML - PCA and Clustering Algorithm.

[LIFE IN LOWER DIMENSIONS...] You are provided with a dataset of 1797 images in a
folder - each image is 8x8 pixels and provided as a feature vector of length 64. You will try
your hands at transforming this dataset to a lower-dimensional space, and clustering the images in
this reduced space.

Write the code from scratch for both PCA and clustering. The only exception is the computation of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for which you could use the numpy in-bulit function.
