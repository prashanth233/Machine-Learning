# PRML - PCA and Clustering Algorithm.

[LIFE IN LOWER DIMENSIONS...] A dataset of 1797 images in a
folder - each image is 8x8 pixels and provided as a feature vector of length 64. Have to try
hands at transforming this dataset to a lower-dimensional space, and clustering the images in
this reduced space.   
{ Exception : The computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for which you could use the numpy in-bulit function. }

The code for both PCA and clustering has been written from scratch.
